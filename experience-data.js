    position: "Warehouse Associate",
    desc: `At Savannah Global Logistics, I held various roles including warehouse manager and associate. Since departing full time work, I still occasionally do work when they need hands. The people there have helped me become who I am today, will continue to shape me in the future, and I owe a few of my most important life lessons to them. I have plenty of love for SGL and the people there. As for the job, I was a Warehouse Associate the majority of my time there. I was warehouse manager briefly for a few months. I oversaw shipments of dangerous goods, military equipment, and just any type of frieght you could imagine. I kept inventory and released items from inventory. I built pallets, crates, and any special equipment needed to get frieght around the world. `,

    position: "Server",
    desc: `I gained valuable experience in customer service and relationship building during my two+ year tenure as a server at The Cheesecake Factory. This experience has been instrumental in my understanding of what makes good customer service. Many people say everyone should be required to work retail/hospitality before entering the career work world. I'm not sure if that's true/false but I do know it has helped me personally develope my customer service skills and I will cary them with me for the rest of my life. At The Cheesecake Factory, I was also a designated trainer, and a shift lead for 90% of the shift's I worked during my time there. What that means is I not only work with customers well but co-workers, so I was who trained other new servers. For shift leading, I closed the restaurant nightly checking out the other servers sidework. Always the last to leave, with the closing managers.`,
