# My-Website and Blog

Time Spent working on this project tracked by WakaTime... not sure if it's always right but I attempt to keep track with it.

## Why?
- I want one place to put everything of mine
- I wanted a blog incorperated ino my portfolio
- I needed to update my information after taking the eJPT to prepare for applications
